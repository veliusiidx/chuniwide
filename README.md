Chuniwide is a way to automatically resize the window when playing Chunithm so you can enjoy playing the game on smaller monitors and have very good performance at the cost of graphic fidelity. This works by resizing the window instead of messing with any drivers. 

Instructions:
Make sure the game runs in windowed mode.
Run Chuniwide in the version of your choice in Admin mode.
Start the game.
Play
