Chuniwide is a way to automatically resize the window when playing Chunithm so you can enjoy playing the game on smaller monitors and have very good performance at the cost of graphic fidelity. This works by resizing the window instead of messing with any drivers. 

Instructions:
Make sure the game runs in windowed mode.
Run Chuniwide in the version of your choice in Admin mode.
Start the game.
Play.

Known issues include the game not correctly zooming out when entering the song select screen sometimes. This is not 100% stable and it sometimes fixes itself depending on what songs are played. However, as far as I've tested, this is 100% stable for when playing a song and when the result screen plays.
